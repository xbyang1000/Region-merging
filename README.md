# Region-merging

A demo for the unsupervised superpixel region-mergeing.

Run demo_RegionMerge.m first, then other files can be called automatically.

These codes have been tested on MATLAB 2017b with windows 7 operating system.

Three slide files named "high-resolution FigureX.pptx" are high-quality region-merging results. The number X in the file name "FigureX" corresponds to the figure in the revised under review manuscript.

This work has been accepted by EAAI, the journal of "Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence".
