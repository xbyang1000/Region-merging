# Region-merging

A demo for the unsupervised superpixel region-mergeing.

Run demo_RegionMerge.m first, then other files can be called automatically.

These codes have been tested on MATLAB 2017b with windows 7 operating system.

Three slide files named "high-resolution FigureX.pptx" are high-quality region-merging results. The number X in the file name "FigureX" corresponds to the figure in the manuscript.

This work has been published by EAAI, the journal of "Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence", as the uploaded file named MaxCov.pdf
